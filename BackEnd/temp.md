❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined as parameters for the `sum` function. This will lead to errors because the function
relies on global variables, which is bad practice.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc comment to explain what the function does and what it requires

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ Function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it reusable and predictable.
* ✔ Added JSDoc comment to improve readability and maintainability.
* ✔ The function is now self-contained and does not rely on external variables.
